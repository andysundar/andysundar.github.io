# About Me

Hi, I'm **Anindya** (Andy) 👋

I'm currently a **Software Architect** at **Hyland** and pursuing my M-Tech in Artificial Intelligence at **IIT Jodhpur**.

## My Journey

**While actively architecting, I'm pursuing my M-Tech in AI at IIT Jodhpur—ensuring I continue making informed architectural decisions as AI becomes foundational infrastructure.**

I have spent 14+ years building and scaling distributed systems in healthcare technology. What motivated me to transition into formal AI education was the need to go beyond integrating AI tools and deeply understand the mathematics and principles driving these tools.

## Current Learning Journey
I'm constantly expanding my horizons:

- Pursuing M-Tech in Artificial Intelligence at IIT Jodhpur 
- Exploring the .NET ecosystem to broaden my polyglot engineering perspective
- Deep-diving into advanced AI research, transformer architectures, and responsible AI practices
